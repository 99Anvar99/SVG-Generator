# SVG-Generator
An SVG generator is a tool or software that allows users to create scalable vector graphics (SVG) files. SVG generators are commonly used by web designers, developers, and graphic artists to create high-quality, resolution-independent graphics for websites, applications, and print materials.

# Installation
- In the command line, run the following command:
```
npm install inquirer@8.2.4 jest
```

# Testing
- Before testing the program, ensure that you are located within the svg-logo-maker directory.
- Next, open your terminal and execute:
```
npm test
```

# Usage
- To begin, clone the repository to your local drive and follow the instructions for installing the dependencies provided earlier. After that, navigate to the project directory by using the 'CD' command in your terminal. Finally, execute the command:
```
node index.js
```
- to initiate the process. Once done, you will receive a set of brief questions regarding text, color, and shape. Answering these questions will generate a new logo, which will be saved in your project directory.
